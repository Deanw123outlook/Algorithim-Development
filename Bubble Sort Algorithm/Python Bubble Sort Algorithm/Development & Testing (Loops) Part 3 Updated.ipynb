    "Updated Version invloves error handling using the try and except keywords. Little progress has been made from previous [Development & Testing (Loops) Part3] , however the inclusion of error handling into our code has brought us one step closer to cracking the Bubble Sort Algorithm code in python!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the below code we have made good progressive in solving & coding the Bubble Sort Algorithm. Below I have mentioned some universally important constructs in computer coding, particularly the counter feature which will play an important role in building this algorithm & many others !"

    "###### Counter Feature\n",
    "In digital logic and computing, a Counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event or process has occurred, often in relationship to a clock signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Counters are used in digital electronics for counting purpose, they can count specific event happening in the circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in UP counter a counter increases count for every rising edge of clock. Not only counting, a counter can follow the certain sequence based on our design like any random sequence 0,1,3,2â€¦ .They can also  be designed with the help of flip flops.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will prove an important feature in delveloping the Bubble Sort Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition assignment (+=)\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition assignment operator (+=) adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. The types of the two operands determine the behavior of the addition assignment operator. Addition or concatenation is possible."
