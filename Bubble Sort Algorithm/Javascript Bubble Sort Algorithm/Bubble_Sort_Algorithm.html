      Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting
      algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent
      elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through
      the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a
      comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble"
      to the top of the list.
